# TwitFix-Extension

This is a pretty cool browser Extension made by [Doruk](https://github.com/DorukSega) that simply adds the option to copy a TwitFix link to your clipboard when right clicking any given video on twitter

This extension is currently undergoing review on the Chrome and Firefox extension stores, but once those are complete I will provide install links here :)
